Why I started Do Good by Doing Better - by Eric Duell.

I started this adventure because I believe in the power of each of us to make a difference. So often, it seems like it's hard for us as individuals to do that. And as with everything, it was a process to get to where I am now, and to start my work with Do Good by Doing Better.

I'd like to share that story with you.

Many people encouraged me to do more writing over the years. It comes naturally to me and I enjoy it. I'm also a photographer, which is interesting, because I find that many people gravitate to either words or pictures, but not both. Kind of like, at least in my experience, the way I've seen friends gravitate to either baking or cooking, but not both.

But I never pursued writing seriously because I felt that my voice was not additive. I believed that I needed to come up with something extremely novel, amazing, or unique to be useful. I know that's not true, but feelings and perceptions exist in their own reality, and I let that hold me back.

Then my friend and colleague Jeremy Goldman invited me to become a contributor to his Substack, The Goldmine, and it forced me to confront this tension.

"What am I about and what can I offer?"

I'm a future-focused thinker and the concept behind my work matters to me. My drive to be clear on "the core idea" is one of the reasons I've been a successful strategist, intrapreneur, and innovator throughout my professional life.

I realized after reflection there's a consistent belief that motivates me - that we can Do Good by Doing Better. And here's what I've come to appreciate.

When we work to advance knowledge and understanding, if even just a little bit with each effort, we do good. Every so often we will make breakthrough discoveries, but more frequently, we'll learn one or two things at each turn that add up over time. The work to build our muscles of curiosity, inquiry, experimentation, and learning propels us as we all innovate and create value. The results are multiplicative, and this is how I and I hope you will Do Good by Doing Better and by doing so, Up Your Impact One Act at a Time.

I think it's a worthy aspiration and I appreciate you joining me on the journey.

Please stay in touch - let me know what topics you're interested in and how I can help you as well.

Thanks again and I hope you enjoy Do Good by Doing Better™ - and that it helps you to Up Your Impact - One Act at a Time!
