# What is a Hook?

A hook is the opener for any content that requires an audience's attention. It is crucial because if you don't intrigue people within the first few seconds, they will disengage by scrolling past, mentally checking out, or marking the content as spam.

A hook is typically the first:
- 1-3 sentences of a post.
- The title slide of a presentation.
- The first few seconds of a video.

A mediocre piece of content with a strong hook has a better chance of success than a strong piece of content with a mediocre hook.

# 10 Methods for Writing Hooks

Based on an analysis of viral posts, here are 10 fundamental ways to write a hook.

## 1. Credibility
- **Principle:** Leverage your own or another's credibility to demonstrate that the content is worth reading. This contextualizes why the audience should take the advice seriously.
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "This person knows their sh*t".
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - **State your experience and accomplishments:** Mention specific achievements, such as revenue milestones, business successes, or personal accomplishments.
    - **Highlight your effort:** Reference the amount of work you put into the content. This leverages the "Labor Illusion," where people perceive something as more valuable when they see the effort put into it.
    - **Leverage someone else's credibility:** If you lack personal credibility on a topic, you can reference a well-known and respected person or company.

## 2. Fear
- **Principle:** Engage the audience's sense of fear or negativity to compel them to keep reading. This works because of psychological principles like Loss Aversion and Negativity Bias.
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "I hope I'm not doing it wrong".
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** Frame the topic in a way that makes the reader feel they will be left behind if they don't engage.
    - **FOBO (Fear of Being Outdone):** Present information that triggers a reader's fear of being outperformed by others.
    - **Invoke fear of doing something wrong:** Use strong language to suggest a common practice is incorrect, positioning your content as the solution.
    - **Warn of negative consequences:** Highlight a potential negative outcome that could happen to the reader.

## 3. Curiosity
- **Principle:** Pique the reader's curiosity to create a desire for a dopamine hit that is satisfied by learning the answer. Frame the hook in a way that makes the reader ask, "Then what happened?" or "I have to know more".
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "Then what?".
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - **Start a story:** Tease an interesting story with colorful language, especially one involving high stakes.
    - **Use strong or shocking words:** Begin with a "hot take" or a statement that "everyone is wrong about...".
    - **Open a loop:** Start a sentence that requires completion to make sense.
    - **Tease a hidden detail:** Present an image or statement and imply there is something important to notice that requires further reading.

## 4. Counter-Narrative
- **Principle:** Go against the grain by presenting a strong opinion or bold claim that contradicts what people believe to be true. This is also known as developing a "spiky point of view".
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "Wait, what? That's the opposite of what I thought was true!".
- **Implementation:** Challenge a commonly held belief or narrative to grab attention and get the audience to continue reading.

## 5. Eloquence
- **Principle:** Articulately give voice to an unvoiced concern, frustration, or opinion held by the target audience. The key is to summarize this shared feeling succinctly and powerfully.
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "Finally, someone said it!".
- **Implementation:** Tap into a shared feeling or frustration. This is particularly effective when tied to a trending topic or news story.

## 6. Faces
- **Principle:** Use visuals of human faces, as people are hardwired to notice them, especially when they are displaying strong emotions.
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - **Show shock or surprise:** A classic technique is an open-mouthed, shocked expression that makes the viewer want to know the cause.
    - **Share a selfie:** A photo of yourself can be combined with a post, but it is most effective when the selfie is relevant to the content.
    - **Boost credibility:** When referencing a well-known person, including their photo combines the "Faces" hook with the "Credibility" hook.
    - **Direct the audience's gaze:** An averted gaze in a photo will draw more attention to a product or element in the image.

## 7. Value
- **Principle:** Directly promise educational value or a useful takeaway. The hook should tell the audience exactly what they are going to get by reading the content.
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - **Be direct:** State the topic and the value clearly.
    - **Handle objections:** Since people can be skeptical of big promises, handle their objections upfront in the hook.

## 8. Surprise
- **Principle:** Use a surprising fact or statistic to hook the reader. People enjoy sharing surprising information, which increases the likelihood of the content being shared.
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "Oh, that's cool!" or "I didn't know that".
- **Implementation:** Use a surprising statistic or a punchy, unexpected statement in one or two sentences.

## 9. Celebration
- **Principle:** Share a win or milestone that the audience can celebrate. These posts have a high engagement rate because people feel compelled to show support.
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "I'm so happy for you!".
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - Announce a new job.
    - Share milestones related to achievements like follower counts, revenue, or awards.
    - Celebrate birthdays, often paired with lessons learned.

## 10. Identity
- **Principle:** Signal who the post is for so that those people immediately know it is relevant to them.
- **Intended Reader Reaction:** "Hey, that's me!".
- **Implementation Strategies:**
    - **Use a Barnum-style statement:** Make a statement that seems specific but is vague enough to apply to a wide range of people.
    - **Label the audience directly:** Call out a specific group by name. It is even more effective to lump yourself into that group and use terminology they use to describe themselves.
