<h1>Building in Public: The Creator Cockpit</h1>
<p>For the past few weeks, I've been working on a new project designed to solve a problem I face every day as a Substack creator: workflow fragmentation.</p>
<p>We juggle so many tools. One for ideas, another for drafting, a third for SEO, a fourth for finding images, and a fifth for scheduling social media. It's a lot. The Creator Cockpit is my attempt to bring all of that into one, unified dashboard.</p>
<p>This post is the first in a series where I'll be building this tool in public, sharing the process, the code, and the lessons learned along the way.</p>
